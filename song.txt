🎷 Careless Whisper
🎤 Song by George Michael and Wham!


🎵 I feel so unsure
🎵 As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
🎵 As the music dies, something in your eyes
🎵 Calls to mind a silver screen
🎵 And all its sad good-byes

🎵 I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
🎵 Though it's easy to pretend
🎵 I know you're not a fool

🎵 I should've known better than to cheat a friend
🎵 And waste the chance that I'd been given
🎵 So I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 The way I danced with you, oh

🎵 Time can never mend
🎵 The careless whispers of a good friend
🎵 To the heart and mind
🎵 Ignorance is kind
🎵 There's no comfort in the truth
🎵 Pain is all you'll find

🎵 I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
🎵 Though it's easy to pretend
🎵 I know you're not a fool

🎵 I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah)
🎵 And waste the chance that I'd been given
🎵 So I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 The way I danced with you, oh

🎵 Never without your love

🎵 Tonight the music seems so loud
🎵 I wish that we could lose this crowd
🎵 Maybe it's better this way
🎵 We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

🎵 We could have been so good together
🎵 We could have lived this dance forever
🎵 But now, who's gonna dance with me?
🎵 Please stay

🎵 And I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
🎵 Though it's easy to pretend
🎵 I know you're not a fool

🎵 I should've known better than to cheat a friend
🎵 And waste the chance that I'd been given
🎵 So I'm never gonna dance again
🎵 The way I danced with you, oh

🎵 now that you're gone
🎵 (Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong
🎵 That you had to leave me alone?
